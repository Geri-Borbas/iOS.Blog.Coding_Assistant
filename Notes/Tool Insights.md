# Tool Insights: Xcode 26 Coding Assistant

*Based on analysis of network log data from Anthropic API requests*

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the tools and capabilities of the Xcode 26 coding assistant, extracted from actual network request/response data captured during assistant interactions. The assistant utilizes Claude 3.7 Sonnet (`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`) as its underlying language model and communicates via the Anthropic API.

## Model Information

- **Model**: `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`
- **API Endpoint**: `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`
- **API Version**: `2023-06-01`
- **User Agent**: `Xcode/24141.23 CFNetwork/3852.100.1 Darwin/25.0.0`

## Tools Analysis

### 1. str_replace_editor

**Type**: `text_editor_20250124`

**Description**: Primary file manipulation tool for viewing, creating, and editing files within the Xcode project context.

**Commands Available**:

#### view
- **Purpose**: View file contents or directory listings

**Usage Examples from Network Logs**:

```json
{
  "name": "str_replace_editor",
  "type": "tool_use",
  "input": {
    "command": "view",
    "path": "/repo"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "str_replace_editor", 
  "type": "tool_use",
  "input": {
    "command": "create",
    "path": "/repo/TokenAnalyzer.swift",
    "file_text": "//\n//  TokenAnalyzer.swift\n..."
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "str_replace_editor",
  "type": "tool_use", 
  "input": {
    "command": "str_replace",
    "old_str": "import SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {",
    "path": "/repo/ContentView.swift",
    "new_str": "import SwiftUI\nimport UniformTypeIdentifiers\n\nstruct ContentView: View {"
  }
}
```

### 2. query_search

**Type**: `custom`

**Description**: Searches the project for contextual information by keyword searching for additional files. Limited to 3 searches per user message.

**Schema**:
```json
{
  "name": "query_search",
  "description": "Query the project for contextual information by keyword searching for additional files. \nYou can do this up to 3 per message the user sends you.\nHowever, the user sees every search you perform, so avoid making noisy or redundant requests when possible â€” and make sure you use your context window wisely.",
  "input_schema": {
    "properties": {
      "queries": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    },
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["queries"],
    "description": "queries"
  },
  "type": "custom"
}
```

**Usage Example**:
```json
{
  "name": "query_search",
  "type": "tool_use",
  "input": {
    "queries": [
      "AppDelegate.swift",
      "TokensApp.swift", 
      "project structure",
      "xcodeproj"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. invalid_function

**Type**: `custom`

**Description**: A disabled tool that is not meant to be used. Appears to be included for completeness or testing purposes.

**Schema**:
```json
{
  "name": "invalid_function",
  "description": "A disabled tool, not to be used.",
  "input_schema": {
    "properties": {},
    "type": "object"
  },
  "type": "custom"
}
```

## Tool Types Discovered

From error logs, additional tool types are supported by the platform:

- `bash_20250124` - Likely for terminal/command execution
- `text_editor_20250124` - Current file editor (actively used)
- `text_editor_20258429` - Alternative/newer text editor version
- `web_search_20250305` - Web search capabilities
- `custom` - Custom tool type for specialized functions

## Assistant Behavior Patterns

### File System Access
The assistant operates within a sandboxed environment where:
- Direct file system access is limited
- Files are accessed via `/repo/` prefix
- Discovery of new files requires `query_search` tool
- All file operations are tracked and visible to users

### Error Handling
When tools fail or are unrecognized:
- Assistant adapts by trying alternative approaches
- Error messages are parsed to adjust tool usage
- Graceful degradation to available tools

### Workflow Patterns
1. **Project Discovery**: Use `query_search` to find relevant files
2. **File Analysis**: Use `str_replace_editor` with "view" command
3. **Code Modification**: Use `str_replace_editor` with "str_replace" command
4. **File Creation**: Use `str_replace_editor` with "create" command

## Rate Limiting

Based on HTTP headers in responses:
- **Input tokens**: 20,000 limit per time window
- **Output tokens**: 8,000 limit per time window  
- **Requests**: 50 requests per time window
- **Combined tokens**: 28,000 total limit

## System Prompt Context

The assistant operates with specialized knowledge for:
- Apple development ecosystem (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS)
- Swift, Objective-C, C, and C++ programming languages
- Swift Testing framework with macros
- Swift Concurrency (async/await, actors)
- Xcode project structure and conventions

## Security & Privacy

- API keys are redacted in logs but appear to use Anthropic's standard format
- Communication uses HTTPS with proper headers
- Request/response data shows no sensitive information leakage
- File paths are normalized to project-relative paths

## Usage Statistics from Sample Session

**Request Volume**: 10+ API calls observed
**File Operations**: 
- 3 file creations (`TokenAnalyzer.swift`, `TokenTests.swift`)
- 2 major file modifications (`ContentView.swift`, `TokensApp.swift`)
- Multiple file view operations

**Search Operations**:
- 4-query search for project structure files
- Successful discovery of `TokensApp.swift`

**Response Sizes**: Ranging from ~1KB to 580KB for complex file creation operations

## Conclusion

The Xcode 26 coding assistant demonstrates sophisticated file manipulation and project understanding capabilities through a focused set of tools. The integration with Anthropic's Claude model provides natural language understanding while the specialized tools enable practical code development tasks within the Xcode environment.

The tool ecosystem appears designed for safety and transparency, with all operations visible to users and appropriate rate limiting in place. The assistant shows adaptive behavior when encountering tool limitations or errors.
